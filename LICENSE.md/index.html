    <p>
      Food tastes like yummy <strong>clouds</strong>.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#ff3100"> <strong>Unicorns</strong> eat food. So should you. Unless you are a plant...
    </p>
    <p style="color:#ff6000"> If you are a plant, then you <strong>make </strong> food.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#fbad00"> But, if you are not a plant, then you have to <strong>get</strong> food.</p>
    <p style="color:#f5ff00"> Then, you'll have to <strong>go</strong> to Trader Joe's or some other store.</p>
    <p style="color:#a8ff00"> Which means, you'll need <strong>money</strong> to buy food at stores.</p>
    <p style="color:#73fd39"> Then, you'll need a <strong>job</strong> to earn money.</p>
    <p style="color:#17ff50"> For example, you can work at <strong>Banana</strong>.</p>
    <p style="color:#00ff81"> Or, you can scoop poop at a <strong>zoo</strong>.</p>
    <p style="color:#08ffc3"> Then, you won't be able to buy a lot of <strong>expensive</strong> chocolate. </p>
    <p style="color:#00b3ff"> 
    That means, you'll be <strong> sad</strong>.</p>
    <p style="color:#006fff"> Then, <strong>42</strong> (meaning of life) won't have any meaning anymore.</p>
    <p style="color:blue"> Then you will <strong>die</strong>.</p>
    <p style="color:#6f00fd"> But you <strong>shouldn't</strong>. So--</p>
    <p style="color:#aa00ff"> Suddenly, <strong>pineapples</strong>!</p>
    <p style="color:#e900ff"> "The End", said the fluffy <strong>chicken</strong>.</p>
    <p style="color:#ff00d1"> "The End," said the fat <strong>cow</strong>.</p>
    <p style="color:#ff008d"> JUST KIDDING! You should be less <strong>gullible</strong>, you know.</p>
    <p style="color:#ff0054"> And you should watch <strong>Gravity Falls</strong> and be turned to stone by a flying eyeball.</p>
    <p> But... <strong>remember:</strong> Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold. Bye!!</p>
